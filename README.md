# React with webpack

This is a basic React starter with bare minimum config.
The great thing is that I configured this myself eliminating the need for create-react-app.
I can now add to it and if I get it how I like, eliminate the dependency on a third-party toolchain.
Bonus: This project is using "Hot Module Replacement" and the react-hot-loader which means saved changes in code are reflected without need for a full reload, which preserves state and is very fast.
